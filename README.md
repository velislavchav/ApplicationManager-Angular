# ApplicationManager

### Description
This site is created to help employees in finding new job and employers in finding new employees.
There are two sections - private and public. In the public part you can register as user/employer, go to the home page or log in the private part.
If you register as "user" and sign in - you should edit your profile, because there will be empty user's data, that can stop employers to hire you. After that, you can search for free job positions and send applications. Submitted applications can be canceled, so don't worry if you sent application for the wrong job.
If you register as "employer" and sign in - you can create job positions, delete owned job positions, access sent applications and etc. Despite of that, pay attention what data are you inserting in register page, because you can edit only your logo picture. 
If you have any problems - connect with the administartor.

### Development server

Run `ng serve --open` for a dev server. The app will automatically open and reload if you change any of the source files.
If the app isn't opening automatically, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. If the port is used already, add `--port NUMBER` to the dev server, where `NUMBER` isn't used port in localhost. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
